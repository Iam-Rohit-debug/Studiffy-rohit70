        <h2><strong> Biochemistry</strong></h2><br>
        <p>Agricultural biochemistry is the study of both chemistry and biochemistry which are important in agricultural production, the processing of raw products into foods and beverages, and in environmental monitoring and remediation. These studies emphasize the relationships between plants, animals and bacteria and their environment.     <br><br>

          <span id="hide">The applications of biochemistry in agriculture are currently widespread and growing.  Studies of nitrogen fixation, photosynthetic efficiency, uses of recombinant DNA, animal and human nutrition and health, genomics and proteomics, and the environmental impact of agricultural chemicals are examples of the wide variety of topics in which biochemistry is seen as an increasingly important component.

            The Department of Biochemistry, Biophysics, and Molecular Biology at Iowa State University is part of both the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences and of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences.  The Department has faculty in both colleges, and some faculty hold joint appointments in other College of Agriculture and Life Sciences departments.  Preparation of undergraduates for biochemically oriented careers in agriculture is one of the Department’s important responsibilities.  The Biochemistry (CALS) major in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences provides a means for preparing students for entry into careers requiring a thorough understanding of biochemistry and molecular biology.  <br><br>
