        <h2>Database Management System</h2><br>
        <p>A database mangement system is essentially nothing more than a <b>Computized data-keeping system</b>.A database management system (DBMS) is a software package designed to define, manipulate, retrieve and manage data in a database. A DBMS generally manipulates the data itself, the data format, field names, record structure and file structure. It also defines rules to validate and manipulate this data. <br><span id="hide">
            A database is a collection of related data which represents some aspect of the real world. A database system is designed to be built and populated with data for a certain task. Users of the system are given facilities to perform several kinds of operations on such a system for either manipulation of the data in the database or the management of the database structure itself. Database Management Systems (DBMSs) are categorized according to their data structures or types.
            What structures exist in a relational database?

            Relational databases include the following structures:
            Database
            A database is a logical grouping of data. It contains a set of related table spaces and index spaces. Typically, a database contains all the data that is associated with one application or with a group of related applications. You could have a payroll database or an inventory database, for example.
            Table
            A table is a logical structure made up of rows and columns. Rows have no fixed order, so if you retrieve data you might need to sort the data. The order of the columns is the order specified when the table was created by the database administrator. At the intersection of every column and row is a specific data item called a value, or, more precisely, an atomic value. A table is named with a high-level qualifier of the owner's user ID followed by the table name, for example TEST.DEPT or PROD.DEPT. There are three types of tables:<br>
            -<em>A base table that is created and holds persistent data</em><br>
            -<em>A temporary table that stores intermediate query results</em><br>
            -<em>A results table that is returned when you query tables.</em></span>
