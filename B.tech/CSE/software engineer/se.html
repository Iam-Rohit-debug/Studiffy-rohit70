        <h2>Software engineering</h2><br>
        <p>Software engineering is an engineering branch associated with development of software product 
            using well-defined scientific principles, methods and procedures. The outcome of software 
            engineering is an efficient and reliable software product. 
            “Software is a collection of documented program.” <span id="hide">
            Software is more than just a program code. A program is an executable code, which serves 
            some computational purpose. Software is considered to be collection of executable 
            programming code, associated libraries and documentations. Software, when made for a 
            specific requirement is called software product.
            Engineering on the other hand, is all about developing products, using well-defined, scientific 
            principles and methods.</span>
