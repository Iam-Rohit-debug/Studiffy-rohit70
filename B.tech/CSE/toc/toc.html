        <h2>Theory of Computation</h2><br>
        <p>Automata theory (also known as Theory Of Computation) is a theoretical branch of Computer Science and Mathematics, which mainly deals with the logic of computation with respect to simple machines, referred to as automata. 

          <span id="hide">  Automata* enables the scientists to understand how machines compute the functions and solve problems. The main motivation behind developing Automata Theory was to develop methods to describe and analyse the dynamic behavior of discrete systems. 
            
            Automata is originated from the word “Automaton” which is closely related to “Automation”. </span>
