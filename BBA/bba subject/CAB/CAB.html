                   <h2> Why Java?</h2><br>
                   <p>Java, not unlike many of the technologies which influence our everyday lives to this very day, originated in California, under the purview of Sun Microsystems, a company founded in 1982 by Andreas Bechtolsheim, Vinod Khosla, and Scott McNeally. With that said, tech-savvy types tend to look more to the future than the past, so if you find yourself more curious about the modern world of coding, or find yourself questioning just how influential Java has been to the world of technology, you don’t particularly want a history lesson. You’re most likely looking for the modern applicability and influence of a technology that has continued to evolve consistently in order to keep up with the times.
    
                    <span id="hide"> Java is a programming language, designed to be concurrent, class-based and object-oriented, as well as a computing platform first released by Sun Microsystems in 1995. An enormous amount of applications and websites will not work unless you have Java installed, and more are created every day. Denying yourself Java is akin to denying yourself access to a technological infrastructure. Java is advertised, and esteemed for its fast performance, security, and reliability.<br><br> Following are the notable features of Java:
                    Object Oriented. In Java, everything is an Object.<br>
                    Platform Independent.<br>
                    Simple.<br>
                    Secure.<br>
                    Architecture-neutral.<br>
                    Portable.<br>
                    Robust.<br>
                    Multithreaded.</p><br><br></span>
