        <h2>consumer Behaviour</h2><br>
        <p>Studying consumer behavior is important because it helps marketers understand what influences consumersâ€™ buying decisions.

            By understanding how consumers decide on a product, they can fill in the gap in the market and identify the products that are needed and the products that are obsolete.
            
           <span id="hide"></span> Studying consumer behavior also helps marketers decide how to present their products in a way that generates a maximum impact on consumers. Understanding consumer buying behavior is the key secret to reaching and engaging your clients, and converting them to purchase from you.
